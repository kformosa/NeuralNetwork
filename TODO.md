TODO List

- Make Matrix and NeuralNetwork classes as a library that can be easily imported in another project (instead of copy/paste files)
- Ability to save a trained network to file in JSON format and load it later on.
- Adding softmax and other activation functions.
- Port the image classifier in processing as another example.
